# Machine Learning Project Description
 University ML projects 

A data science team at Sirio Libanês, a top-tier hospital in Brazil, decided to use ML to help reduce the strain on hospital’s ICU beds where the objective is to develop a ML model to predict if a patient of confirmed COVID-19 case would require admission to the ICU.  With that objective in mind, the team has collected a decent amount of clinical data from patients i.e. the features of COVID patients, and the target (those been admitted to ICU).

The dataset is released on Kaggle platform with full data description at the following URL (https://www.kaggle.com/S%C3%ADrio-Libanes/covid19) by the team seeking interesting solutions and findings from the public.


In this assignment, you are challenged to perform a full lifecycle ML model development according to the objective of the dataset, which includes the following elements:
1)    Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and establish hypotheses of predictive insights you expect to glean from the dataset. 
2)    Perform data preparation for ML informed by the EDA findings.
3)    Develop ML model according to hypotheses of predictive insights you gleaned from the dataset. You are required to evaluate at least 3 ML algorithms and assess associated issues i.e. hyperparameters tuning, performance metrics, model complexity (underfitting/overfitting) etc.  Finally, provide a recommendation of the best algorithm for your ML model.
